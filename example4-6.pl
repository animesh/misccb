# The filename of the file containing the protein sequence data
$proteinfilename = 'NM_021964fragment.pep';

# First we have to "open" the file, and associate
# a "filehandle" with it.  We choose the filehandle
# PROTEINFILE for readability.
open(PROTEINFILE, $proteinfilename);

# Now we do the actual reading of the protein sequence data from the file,
# by using the angle brackets < and > to get the input from the
# filehandle.  We store the data into our variable $protein.
#
# Since the file has three lines, and since the read only is
# returning one line, we'll read a line and print it, three times.

# First line
$protein = <PROTEINFILE>;

# Print the protein onto the screen
print "\nHere is the first line of the protein file:\n\n";

# Second line

# Print the protein onto the screen

# Third line
$protein = <PROTEINFILE>;

# Print the protein onto the screen
print "\nHere is the third line of the protein file:\n\n";
