=head1 NAME

verify-link-control - check that linkcontroller setup is correct

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program simply loads the configuration for LinkController and
then carries out some simple tests to see if all is as it should be.

If any problems are detected then it suggests corrective action,
either a variable which should be added to the configuration file
(.link-control in the users home directory) or a program which should
be run.

=head1 BUGS

This program needs to have lots of things added

=over 4

=item *

A large proportion of the links in the database are scheduled in the
past.  This may mean that you aren't running test-links often enough.  You
may want to rebuild the schedule with build-schedule.  If you have
very many links to check then you may need to adjust some
parameters... FIXME: which??

Before running test-link again, you probably want to try running
build-schedule in order to avoid getting a pulst of activity.

If you find test-link is running and testing continuously, and still
isn't testing all of your links often enough, then you have reached
the limit of the current design.  You will have to look for ways to
improve it.  Consider contributing (or paying a programmer to
contribute) a parallelised link checking routine.
