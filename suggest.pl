=head1 NAME

suggest - suggest alternatives to a link

=head1 SYNOPSIS

suggest first-link-name suggestion....

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program records alternatives to a link in a database.  It is
designed to be able to run SUID and record these suggestions in a
central database where anyone can access them.

It accepts no command line options beyond the first link name and the
suggestions.

No attempt is made to guard against suggestions which are useless or
which point to sites which might upset the user.  Possibly we should
log what suggestions are made.

This program trusts the database who's filename is built into it.
