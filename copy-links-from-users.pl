=head1 NAME

copy-links-from-users - get link files for use by link-controller

=head1 SYNOPSIS

copy-links-from-users [options] username.. destfile

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is designed to check through all of the user's
directories and get lists of links which can then used to build a
central link database using C<extract-links>

B<--user>

B<--group>

=head1 NOTES

This program has not been audited at all for security yet and isn't
safe to run as root.  In the long term, the aim is that this should be
safe to run as root.  However, even so, you should not do that!!!  It
will work better if run as a normal user.
