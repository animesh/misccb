=head1 NAME

demo_writer.pl -- a lame sample program for outputting RTF

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  Read the source of this program.
  It's ejumucational.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of my many superpowers is writing Perl programs that read lexical
databases, chew them up, and spit out a tidily formatted
dictionary, in RTF.

Why RTF?  Just convenience -- I happened to know a
bit about RTF, and I didn't know TeX.  (And XML+XSL didn't
exist at the time.)  For ages I wrote (and rewrote, anew each time)
completely ad-hoc code to
spit out RTF.  But after a few years of having to consult the icky
I<RTF Specification> to remember how to turn on page numbering,
or emit a useful prolog, I decided to write RTF::Writer, to
simplify these tasks.

This program, demo_writer.pl, is just an example program that
uses RTF::Writer to emit RTF.  The RTF it happens to emit, is
a miniature lexicon file, based an a miniature lexical
database as input.

See also L<RTF::Writer|RTF::Writer> and
L<RTF::Cookbook|RTF::Cookbook>.
