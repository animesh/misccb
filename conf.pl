### basic configuration
### You'll have to adapt these values if you didn't use setup.pl

# Where you want the indexer to start. [re-index]
$DOCUMENT_ROOT = 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\/';

# The base url of your site.
$BASE_URL = '172.16.2.215';

# Only files with these extensions should be indexed. [re-index]
@EXT = ("htm","html","shtml","asp","txt");

# If you do not have telnet/ssh access to the server that runs the script, you
# need to execute indexer.pl via CGI. Of course not everybody should be able
# to do that, so set a password with this option.
# ** WARNING ** : Only use this if absolutely necessary! Setting to "" disables 
# execution as a CGI, which is much more secure. Note that other people on
# your server can probably read this file and look up your password.

### http configuration
### You only need this if you want to index your pages via http

# Where you want the indexer to start via http. Leave empty if
# you want to index the files in the filesystem ($DOCUMENT_ROOT).

# resouces on other people's servers. [re-index]
# example: $HTTP_START_URL = 'http://localhost/';

# The indexer might not notice if it runs into an endless loop. To void
# that, set this to the maximum number of pages that will be visited
# (this can be bigger than the number of pages indexed). [re-index]

# The web server's document root. Normally that's the same as $DOCUMENT_ROOT,
# it differs if you're only using Perlfect Search on a subdirectory. [re-index]

# Only if indexing via http: limit crawling to this URL. This is an
# important setting so the script doesn't run out of control. [re-index]

# that will print ASCII to STDOUT if called this way: "program pdf_filename -".
