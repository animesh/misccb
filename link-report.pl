=head1 NAME

link-report - report status of links using databases

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program goes through an entire database of links and reports
information about those links which match given criteria.  It can
optionally relate these to the locations of these links in files.  It
can give the output in several formats.

No actions are carried out to get further information than that which
is in the database.  This means that if a URI isn't listed in the link
database, a warning is printed, but nothing else.

Distributed along with this program is a file for emacs which can use
this to build a list of files for editing called link-report-dired.
This can be very useful for fixing all broken links.

=head1 SELECTING LINKS TO REPORT

This bit is where we really miss in the design by not doing it against
an SQL database.  When (and if) that comes then we can add alot more
power here more simply.

There are three modes for selection

=over 4

=item *

by URI

=item *

by regex on the URI --uri-include --uri-exclude

=item *

by regex on the page name --page-include --page-exclude

=back

These select which links are to be examined.  Then there are options
on the state of the link which choose which links to actually put out
information about.

By default redirected and broken links are output.  If any of these
options are called then only the specified links are output.

=over 4

=item --all-links

print out links in all states

=item --not-perfect

print out all links which were broken even on one check.

=item --redirected

print out links which were redirected

=back

=head1 CONTROLLING THE REPORT FORMAT

The list of broken links can be put out in several formats.  By
defualt it is in plain text with a description of the problem and a
list of broken pages following under each link.  Alternatively other
formats are possible.  These are selected through command line
options as follows.

=over 4

=item --long-list

Instead of listing the urls of the pages where broken links are, this
converts each link to a file name and does a listing of the file.

=item --html

This outputs a basic HTML format report which is otherwise similar to
the default text report.

=item --uri-report

This report simply lists URIs of the selected links from
LinkControllers database.  This provides a better format for
interfacing to other programs.

=back

=head1 TODO

Much detailed control of the kind of links reported should be provided
(e.g. how many times detected broken etc.).  This should be done as a
more advanced database system is integrated.

If there's any specific, reasonably simple, reporting option you would
like added then please send a request to the bug reporting address
explaining what this report would be used for.

=head1 BUGS

If reporting options which don't make sense together are given then
the reporting probably won't make much sense, though it should still
work.
