# Example 4-5   Reading protein sequence data from a file

# The filename of the file containing the protein sequence data
$proteinfilename = 'NM_021964fragment.pep';

# First we have to "open" the file, and associate
# a "filehandle" with it.  We choose the filehandle
# PROTEINFILE for readability.
open(PROTEINFILE, $proteinfilename);

# Now we do the actual reading of the protein sequence data from the file,
# by using the angle brackets < and > to get the input from the
# filehandle.  We store the data into our variable $protein.
$protein = <PROTEINFILE>;

# Now that we've got our data, we can close the file.
close PROTEINFILE;

# Print the protein onto the screen
print "Here is the protein:\n\n";
